The (20) QA bAbI tasks are a set of proxy tasks that evaluate reading
comprehension via question answering. Our tasks measure understanding
in several ways: whether a system is able to answer questions via chaining facts,
simple induction, deduction and many more. The tasks are designed to be prerequisites
for any system that aims to be capable of conversing with a human.
The aim is to classify these tasks into skill sets, so that researchers
can identify (and then rectify) the failings of their systems.

This custom variant of bAbI turns the task into a simple QA classification task.
